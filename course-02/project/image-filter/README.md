# Udagram Image Filtering Microservice

### Setup Local Environment

You'll need to create a new node server. Open a new terminal within the project directory and run:

1. Initialize a new project: `npm i`
2. run the development server with `npm run dev`

### Elastic Beanstalk Endpoint (accessible until I take down the service)

Endpoint: http://image-filter-dev.ca-central-1.elasticbeanstalk.com

Sample usage: http://image-filter-dev.ca-central-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/filteredimage?image_url=https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/kitten-report.jpg
